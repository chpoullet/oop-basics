## Definitions

Class - a class is a blueprint for objects. Inside we define the object's characteristics and behaviours.
With classes, you can create instances of that class.
 
Instances - are the occurrence of an object of a specific class.

Methods - are like a function, but can only run on a specific data type or object of it's own class.

__init__ method - a method that runs every time you initialise/create an object aka: constructor method.
